        <div class="justified-text">Scram has originally began development in 2016 and was published on Steam in 2018. Scram is a satirical multiplayer first person shooter with paper arts and crafts type inspired aesthetics.
			Scram is designed to be a silly fun game with interesting game mechanics.
	</div>

        <div class="justified-text">Multiple different concepts of the game was experimented with. "Dread Signal" was the very first version of Scram which was basically a 2D story mode of the game. Then, the game was later re-developed into a fully 3D multiplayer first person implementation and the Scram prototype version with a cartoon inspired art style was experimented with. 
	Finally, the original Scram was concluded and distributed on Steam in 2018.
	</div>

        <div class="justified-text">Scram 2 was designed to become the ultimate sequel to the Scram series. It was engineered to have interesting weapons that Scram has never seen before. It would be included with intense parkour mechanics unlike the basic movement of the
original game, as well as more mutant classes, and maps to offer more gameplay variations. The game mode was intended to be much more diverse and replayable by implementing random rescue locations, ammo boxes, and well-placed vending machines to diversify gameplay rounds unlike the original
Scram which only offered a single static way of playing.
